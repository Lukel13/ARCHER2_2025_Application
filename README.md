Graph showing scaling for ASPECT using NIAGARA (dotted lines) and ARCHER2 (solid lines). The largest (136.8e6 DoF), medium (48.8e6 DoF), and smallest (11.9e6 DoF) models were ran on ARCHER2 to determine the optimum number of nodes to use for each model. It was found that large jobs run optimally on 11 nodes (1408 cores), medium jobs on 5 nodes (640 cores), and small jobs on 2 nodes (256 cores).
